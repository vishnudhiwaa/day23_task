The project is a shopping cart developed using React that allows users to add and remove items from the cart.
Users will be able to add items to the cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button.
When an item is added to the cart, the cart quantity number will be increased.
The "Add to Cart" button will be changed to the "Remove from Cart" button once the item is added to the cart.
Users will be able to remove items from the cart by clicking the "Remove from Cart" button.
When an item is removed from the cart, the cart quantity number will be decreased.
The "Remove from Cart" button will be changed back to the "Add to Cart" button once the item is removed from the cart.
When the Cart button is clicked, it resets to zero.
